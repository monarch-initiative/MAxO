Administration of desmopressin (Deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin), the synthetic analog of AVP, after water deprivation should help with differentiating patients with central DI from those with nephrogenic DI as the former should be able to concentrate the urine once the deficient action of AVP is replaced with desmopressin, while the latter should not show a significant response due to end-organ resistance to the action of AVP or its analogs.
