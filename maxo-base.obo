A retinoic acid agent may exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties and may inhibit ornithine decarboxylase, resulting in a decrease in polyamine synthesis and keratinization.

A proton pump inhibitor is orally administered in the neutrally charged, inactive form and, upon entering the acidic environment of the parietal cell, gets protonated and converted into its active form. The active form will covalently and irreversibly bind to the proton pump, the H+/K+-ATPase, located on the surface of parietal cells. This leads to an inhibition of the transport of hydrogen ions, in exchange for potassium ions, into the gastric lumen and results in an inhibition of gastric acid secretion." [NCIT:C29723]

comment: A classical agent (Freund's adjuvant, BCG, Corynebacterium parvum, et al.) contains bacterial antigens. It could also be endogenous (e.g., histamine, interferon, transfer factor, tuftsin, interleukin-1). Its mode of action is either non-specific, resulting in increased immune responsiveness to a wide variety of antigens, or antigen-specific, i.e., affecting a restricted type of immune response to a narrow group of antigens. The therapeutic efficacy is related to its antigen-specific immunoadjuvanticity. {xref="CHEBI:50847"}

The disordered carbohydrate metabolism that underlies diabetes manifests as hyperglycemia. Plasma glucose concentrations in healthy individuals vary with age. Normal fasting plasma glucose intervals (in the morning after an overnight fast) in children are 3.3 - 5.6 mmol/L (60-100 mg/dL); adult range - 4.1- 5.9 mmol/L (74-106 mg/dL). GPCs are approximately 11% higher than whole blood if the hematocrit is normal. Glucose concentrations in heparinized plasma are reported to be 5% lower than in serum. {xref="NCIT:C41376"}

def: "Treatment with a diuretic agent that produces diuresis without increasing potassium excretion." []
comment: Potassium sparing diuretics are generally either aldosterone antagonists and thus prevent the aldosterone-mediated promotion of sodium and water retention, or are epithelial sodium channel blockers and prevent the exchange of potassium for sodium in the distal convoluted tubule. These agents cause diuresis without increasing potassium secretion and thus do not cause hypokalemia. {xref="NCIT:C49186"}

comment: Thiazide diuretics inhibit the sodium-chloride transporter in the distal tubule in the kidneys, thereby suppressing sodium and chloride reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and increasing the excretion of sodium, chloride, potassium and water. In addition, thiazide diuretics decrease excretion of calcium and uric acid. These agents cause vasodilation possibly by activating calcium-activated potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. {xref="NCIT:C49185"}

def: "Treatment with sulfonamide urea derivatives with antihyperglycemic activity." []
comment: Sulphonylurea antidiabetic agents bind to sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (SUR1), the subunit of ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifier potassium (IKATP) channels on the membranes of pancreatic beta cells, thereby blocking the inward current flow (influx) of positively charged K+ ions into the cell. This results in tonic membrane depolarization, and induces a calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels; increased intracellular calcium ion levels trigger exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. This eventually induces secretion of insulin. The IKATP channels found in pancreatic islets are complexes of four IKATP 6.2 and four SUR1 subunits. In addition, some sulfonylureas of larger molecular size may increase the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). {xref="NCIT:C97936"}

def: "A recommendation to avoid infection with toxoplasmosis especially when pregnant due to serious risk of passing the infection on to the baby." []
comment: Cats play an important role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. They become infected by eating infected rodents, birds, or other small animals. The parasite is then passed in the cat’s feces. Kittens and cats can shed millions of parasites in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. Cats and kittens prefer litter boxes, garden soils, and sandboxes for elimination, and you may be exposed unintentionally by touching your mouth after changing a litter box, or after gardening without gloves. Fruits and vegetables may have contact with contaminated soil or water also, and you can be infected by eating fruits and vegetables if they are not cooked, washed, or peeled. {xref="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html"}
comment: Risk is most profound by a pregnant mother passing toxoplasmosis to their infant.  Infected infants do not have symptoms at birth but can develop serious symptoms later in life, such as blindness or mental disability. {xref="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html"}

comment: Two new ventilatory techniques with almost identical names have been developed for adults: BiPAP(trademark) and BIPAP. BiPAP is a trade name derived from 'bi-level positive airway pressure'. BiPAP delivers, by mask, two levels of pressure in response to patient flow. It is intended to support ventilation in a nonin-vasive way in spontaneously but insufficiently breathing patients in the home care environment. In contrast, BIPAP (biphasic positive airway pressure) is a mode of ventilation developed for full ventilatory support in intensive care settings with the use of an endotracheal tube. {xref="PMID:11353935"}

def: "A surgical procedure aimed at lowering the intraocular pressure by producing an outflow of aqueous humour through a drainage passage created in the sclera between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space." []
comment: The filtering procedure involves full thickness penetration of sclera to remove a small portion of the trabecular meshwork or surrounding tissue; it bypasses the natural outflow system by diverting aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into a subconjunctival reservoir with a filtering bleb on the eye. Antifibrotic agents, such as mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil, may be used intraoperatively and postoperatively to reduce scarring and prevent closure of the new channel.
