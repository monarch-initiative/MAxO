comment: Highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. It could be used as an antineoplastic agent, but it might be very toxic, with carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and immunosuppressant actions. It could also be used as a component of poison gases. {xref="CHEBI:22333"}

comment: A classical agent (Freund's adjuvant, BCG, Corynebacterium parvum, et al.) contains bacterial antigens. It could also be endogenous (e.g., histamine, interferon, transfer factor, tuftsin, interleukin-1). Its mode of action is either non-specific, resulting in increased immune responsiveness to a wide variety of antigens, or antigen-specific, i.e., affecting a restricted type of immune response to a narrow group of antigens. The therapeutic efficacy is related to its antigen-specific immunoadjuvanticity. {xref="CHEBI:50847"}

This type of agent is typically used as an antidepressant and in the treatment of anxiety disorders and some personality disorders. They are also typically effective and used in treating some cases of insomnia." [NCIT:C94725]
comment: Any agent that increases the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) by inhibiting its reuptake into the presynaptic cell. Increased level in the synaptic cleft prolongs the action of 5-HT on the postsynaptic receptor. This type of agent is typically used as an antidepressant and in the treatment of anxiety disorders and some personality disorders. They are also typically effective and used in treating some cases of insomnia. {xref="NCIT:C94725"}

These substances act in either paracrine or autocrine fashion on marrow cells, appear to act synergistically in complex and poorly understood ways.  Each appears to exert actions on several lines of progenitor cells and to influence end cell function.  Treatment with colony-stimulating factors (CSF) can help the blood-forming tissue recover from the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  These factors include interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)."

comment: Glucose Plasma Concentration (GPC) measurement is an essential diagnostic modality for different types of carbohydrate metabolism derangements including diabetes mellitus. The disordered carbohydrate metabolism that underlies diabetes manifests as hyperglycemia. Plasma glucose concentrations in healthy individuals vary with age. Normal fasting plasma glucose intervals (in the morning after an overnight fast) in children are 3.3 - 5.6 mmol/L (60-100 mg/dL); adult range - 4.1- 5.9 mmol/L (74-106 mg/dL). GPCs are approximately 11% higher than whole blood if the hematocrit is normal. Glucose concentrations in heparinized plasma are reported to be 5% lower than in serum. {xref="NCIT:C41376"}

Molecular imaging can be combined with anatomical imaging by using specialized cameras. The most common diagnostic applications of Nuclear Medicine include the early detection of coronary artery disease, cancer diagnosis and staging and the evaluation of the effect of cancer treatment. The fusion of molecular and anatomical information increases diagnostic accuracy and changes medical management. Radioactive materials are also used to treat a variety of health problems, including thyroid disorders and cancer. {xref="abms.org"}

In addition, thiazide diuretics decrease excretion of calcium and uric acid. These agents cause vasodilation possibly by activating calcium-activated potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. {xref="NCIT:C49185"}

def: "Treatment with sulfonamide urea derivatives with antihyperglycemic activity." []
comment: Sulphonylurea antidiabetic agents bind to sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (SUR1), the subunit of ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifier potassium (IKATP) channels on the membranes of pancreatic beta cells, thereby blocking the inward current flow (influx) of positively charged K+ ions into the cell. This results in tonic membrane depolarization, and induces a calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels; increased intracellular calcium ion levels trigger exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. This eventually induces secretion of insulin. The IKATP channels found in pancreatic islets are complexes of four IKATP 6.2 and four SUR1 subunits. In addition, some sulfonylureas of larger molecular size may increase the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). {xref="NCIT:C97936"}

name: avoid toxoplasmosis exposure
def: "A recommendation to avoid infection with toxoplasmosis especially when pregnant due to serious risk of passing the infection on to the baby." []
comment: Cats play an important role in the spread of toxoplasmosis. They become infected by eating infected rodents, birds, or other small animals. The parasite is then passed in the cat’s feces. Kittens and cats can shed millions of parasites in their feces for as long as 3 weeks after infection. Mature cats are less likely to shed Toxoplasma if they have been previously infected. Cats and kittens prefer litter boxes, garden soils, and sandboxes for elimination, and you may be exposed unintentionally by touching your mouth after changing a litter box, or after gardening without gloves. Fruits and vegetables may have contact with contaminated soil or water also, and you can be infected by eating fruits and vegetables if they are not cooked, washed, or peeled. {xref="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html"}
comment: Risk is most profound by a pregnant mother passing toxoplasmosis to their infant.  Infected infants do not have symptoms at birth but can develop serious symptoms later in life, such as blindness or mental disability. {xref="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html"}
